# Tourism-Intelligence-FYP
Repository for my Final Year Project on _Sri Lankan Tourism Intelligence_.

# Project Overview
This project applies an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-Means) to analyse and segment the inbound tourism market of Sri Lanka. Using historical arrival data (2011–2024)*, the project moves beyond simple volume metrics to identify strategic clusters based on behavioral traits such as Growth Potential, Value (Duration of Stay), Seasonality and more.

The goal is to provide data-driven insights for formulating strategies in targeted marketing and capacity planning in the post-crisis tourism landscape.

*Currently data available till 2019.
